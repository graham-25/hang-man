Hang Man

This game was a bit hard to understand but I got the jist of it, I had to use a viriaty of for loops and if statements just to be able to siver through the lists to find out if a certin element had a duplicate.  I have got a program that runs a game, it allows the user to guess 12 wrong guesses before ending the game.

First the user is asked to choose one of the following options, only option 1 works at the moment.  The game starts and the system selects a word from random for the user to guess.
