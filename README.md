Hang Man

This game was a bit hard to understand but I got the jist of it, I had to use a viriaty of for loops and if statements just to be able to siver through the lists to find out if a certin element had a duplicate.  I have got a program that runs a game, it allows the user to guess 12 wrong guesses before ending the game.
